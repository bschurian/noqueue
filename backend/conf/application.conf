# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,

# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)

# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
